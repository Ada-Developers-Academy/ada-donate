    <h1>Donate to Ada Developers Academy</h1>
    <p>Ada Developers Academy is a non-profit training program for women and gender diverse people going into careers in software development. The eleven-month intensive program is tuition-free and provides a combination of stipends and low-interest loans to its participants to draw from the broadest set of qualified applicants, regardless of their financial means. To continue to provide low-interest loans that don’t require repayment until after graduation, for living expenses, Ada needs your help to reach our goal of $300K by the end of 2017. Your donation will seed our revolving loan fund and will be utilized by our non-profit lending partner Craft3 to support Ada participants over the next 10 years.</p>
    <p>Your gift will give the most vulnerable candidates a shot at a great career as a software engineer. Thank you.</p>
